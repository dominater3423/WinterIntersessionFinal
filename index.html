    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This website is dedicated to documenting what I did for my winter break, for our school we had two weeks between December 21 and January 6. Of course it's the holidays so that's mainly what's worth talking about. I spent the first few days at home, then went on my way to my grandma's house. We have a small Christmas on Christmas eve with my extended family. After that it's actual Christmas and after a few more days in Chico, where she lives, I went home. That took up a week, and on the second I spend the entire week at home.</p>
    <h2>Family Christmas</h2>
    <p>We spend a Christmas with just my family, at home. My mom always makes cinnamon rolls. For gifts I got another bookself. Yeah, I'm not sure what to say about it...</p>
    <h2>To Grandmother's House We Go</h2>
    <p>My grandma lives in Chico and we have always spent our Christmas at her house. In Chico there isn't much to do, compared to here, so as much as I love seeing my grandma I don't exactly enjoin spending my time there. You end up doing nothing, lots of movies and board games. Though I did do something productive, I helped my grandma upgrade to Windows 10, support just ended yesterday, at the time of writing this.</p>
    <h2>Christmas</h2>
    <p>My Christmas wasn't exactly eventful, though maybe that's a good thing. We had breakfast, open presents, and all those other things associated with the holiday. One thing I, admittedly, don't enjoy about Christmas is that every year my grandma hosts a party bringing in the extended family. I find it painful to pretend to be nice and enjoy having conversation with people I only see once a year. For presents I got a new motherboard and power supply for my computer and a couple of niche books.</p>
    <h2>Week at Home</h2>
    <p>It had been a while since I got to spend time at home, so this week was nice. Most people don't seem to have the ability to entertain myself for extended periods of time mostly by themselves, yeah I don't have this problem. Well what did you engage yourself in? Well I set up my rift again, it had been collecting dust under my bed for awhile now. I picked up chess and learned some basic strategies. Then just read anytime inbetween. Also, I finally did something with my pi, that is the computer not the food, which is mentioned below.</p>
    <h2>Adventures With Retropie</h2>
    <p>My Raspberry Pi was another device that I neglected, so I finally decided to do something about it. I decided to install retropie, which is just a linux distribution that makes emulating old videos games a breeze, and conveniently originally build and optimized for the pi. Installation was easy and all I had to do was find a decent place to download games. I found a nice torrent that contained entire collections of all the major retro systems. I had a kick of watching my dad play some of the games he played as a kid, atari2600 if your curious.</p>
